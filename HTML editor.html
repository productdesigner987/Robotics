<h2><span style="color: blue;"> Introduction </span></h2>
</div>
<p>Robotics is an activity worldwide that people do. In it, you have to build a robot, code it, and then bring it to competition. There are four main types of robotics: FLL, WRO, OPEN, and VEX.</p>
<div>
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;"> FLL Robotics</span></h2>
</div>
<p>FLL's robots is coded by coding blocks and built by LEGO blocks. There is a challenge every single year that you have to do. 2019's challenge was the City Shaper, where you had to help make the city smarter using your robot. Each year has the Game part of it and the Innovation part of it, where you have to use robots and your innovation smarts to fullfill the year's topic. In 2019, contestants ere supposed to find a problemin the city and try to solve it.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;">WRO Robotics</span></h2>
<p>WRO robots are coded by the same coding blocks and the same LEGO blocks. However, WRO has a theme for each year and only has the Game part of it. There is no innovation. WRO robotics can be separated into two types of robotics: OPEN, and just WRO itself.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;">OPEN Robotics</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">OPEN robotics is very different. OPEN, as the name tells you, is <em>open. </em>You can do any type of robotics in it: VEX, WRO, or FLL. It doesn't matter. You use a robot to demonstrate your problem and how you're going to solve it, but it doesn't really matter for the robotics. Most of it is just the story you tell.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;">VEX Robotics</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">VEX robotics is probably, in my opinion, the most fun. Every year, there is a different theme. This year's is Tower Takeover. In VEX, you use metal pieces and other realistic materials to build your robot. You can code with C, CC, C++, and other C languages. In VEX robotics, you commonly use the remote control.</span></p>
